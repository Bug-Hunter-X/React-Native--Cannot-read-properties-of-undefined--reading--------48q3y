This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or when components mount before data is ready.

```javascript
// Example: accessing user.name before user is loaded
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUserData().then(setUser);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text> // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
    </View>
  );
};
```
