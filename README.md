# React Native: Handling 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')'

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications:  'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')'. This error arises when attempting to access a property of an object that is currently null or undefined.  The example provided focuses on asynchronous data fetching, where a component might try to access data before it's fully loaded.

## Problem
The core issue stems from accessing object properties before the object itself is properly initialized.  Asynchronous operations like network requests introduce this timing problem.  If a component renders before the data arrives, trying to access properties will throw this error.

## Solution
This repository offers two main solutions:

1. **Conditional Rendering:**  Check if the data is available before rendering elements that depend on it.
2. **Optional Chaining:** Safely access nested properties using the optional chaining operator (`?.`).

Both approaches are demonstrated in the provided code examples, showcasing best practices for handling asynchronous data in React Native.
